# Python Examples

Please see [this page](https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/PythonDevelopment) to learn how to setup your environment to use VTK in Python.

It would be appreciated if there are any Python VTK experts who could convert any of the [c++ examples](/Cxx) to Python!

## VTK Classes Summary

This Python script, [SelectExamples](../Python/Utilities/SelectExamples), will let you select examples based on a VTK Class and language. It requires Python 3.7 or later. The following tables will produce similar information.

- [VTK Classes with Examples](/Coverage/PythonVTKClassesUsed.md), this table is really useful when searching for example(s) using a particular class.

- [VTK Classes with No Examples](/Coverage/PythonVTKClassesNotUsed.md), please add examples in your area of expertise!
